# open

Similar to the macOS "open" command, which opens a file/folder with the correct programs

## Installation

The program really is just 12 lines. Feel free to download how ever you like it.
```
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/open https://git.reocelot.com/smadhur/open/raw/branch/main/open
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/open
```
